# Rules of NotesHub
1) DO NOT rename old files.
    - Renaming old files will break links to those files.
    - It is OK to rename new files, but as soon as a file is referenced by another file do not rename it.
2) AVOID editing files that other people are editing.
    - This will help prevent merge conflicts.
    - Merge errors can be resolved. But it is better to avoid them. They may lead to some data loss.
3) When possible, link to other files.
    - The goal of this note taking method is to create a network of files.
    - This helps to reduce redundancy and conflicts in our notes and research.

# File Creation best practices


# Merge conflict
If multiple people are editing a note, a merge conflicts can occur.

If during the notebook synchronization notes can't be merged without conflicts, two alternative variants will be provided so you can pick the right one.

```
:::conflict{variant=a}
some text
:::

:::conflict{variant=d}
altered text
:::
```

:::conflict{variant=a}
some text
:::

:::conflict{variant=d}
altered text
:::
