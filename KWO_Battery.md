Today (5/13/2024), It was discovered that the KWO slides our group was using for testing concentrations of acetone, exhibit properties similar to batteries. This discovery came after Aaron K accidentally left a KWO slide connected to the Keithley multi meter on the ohms setting for approximately 72 hours. After which, the slide showed significant discoloration along one terminal of the slide.

This was observed on Monday 5/13/2024 by Aaron K and Aaron W after the weekend. After observing the discoloration, both Aarons decided to test the slides response to acetone. After observing that the resistance across the slide appeared to be negative, Aaron W decided to connect the slide to a volt-meter to determine if the slide was holding a charge. The slide had a potential of 0.91V ~ 0.93V, and after being shorted, would recover to near the original potential.
